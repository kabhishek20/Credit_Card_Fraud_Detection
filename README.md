# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

A <code>**Machine Learning Project**</code> to detect the Fraud Transactions using <code>**Logistic Regression**</code>.

- Dataset used to train the model was downloaded from <code>**Kaggle**</code> which had a record for <code>**284807 transactions**</code>.
- <code>**284315 transactions**</code> were safe, and they were given a class of 0.
- <code>**492 transactions**</code> was fraudulent and they were assigned a class of 1.
- Clearly this was an <code>**Imbalanced Dataset**</code> so I had to used <code>**Oversampling**</code> of fraudulent transactions.
- Once my dataframe was ready, I used <code>**train_test_split**</code> with the <code>**test size to be 20%**</code>.
- The <code>**LogisticRegression model**</code> was trained and it reached an <code>**accuracy of 91.69%**</code>.\
